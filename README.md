# 🧠 Real-Time Code Editor

**RealTimeCodeEditor** is a dynamic, real-time collaborative code editor built using the **MERN stack** — **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React**, and **Node.js**. It allows multiple users to join the same coding session from anywhere in the world and collaborate live on code.  

With real-time typing indicators, user presence tracking, and language-based syntax highlighting, this project delivers a seamless experience for developers working together on shared code in real time.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. A user creates or joins a coding room using a **unique Room ID**.  
2. The app connects all participants using **Socket.IO** for live synchronization.  
3. Any text change is broadcast instantly to all connected users.  
4. When a user selects a programming language, the editor automatically updates syntax highlighting and formatting.
